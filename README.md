# Wave Tone

A simple WebAudio tone generator responsive to a single dimension of device motion.

This is a simple web page, not a web app; i.e. no Bower, no SASS, no magic.

**Note**: During development, using "[watch-http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watch-http-server)" (or just "whs") is pretty handy.
